**European Economic Area (EEA) developers**If your billing address is in the European Economic Area, effective on 8 July 2025, the[Google Maps Platform EEA Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms/maps-platform/eea)will apply to your use of the Services. Functionality varies by region.[Learn more](https://developers.google.com/maps/comms/eea/faq).

## Introduction

[Text Search (New)](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText)returns information about a set of places based on a string (for example, "pizza in New York" or "shoe stores near Ottawa" or "123 Main Street"). The service responds with a list of places matching the text string and any location bias that has been set.

In addition to[required parameters](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#required-parameters), Text Search (New) supports refining queries using[optional parameters](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#optional-parameters)for better results.

## Text Search (New) requests

A Text Search (New) request is an HTTP POST request of the following form:  

```text
https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText
```

Pass all parameters in the JSON request body or in headers as part of the POST request. For example:  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: <var translate="no">API_KEY</var>' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.priceLevel' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

## Text Search (New) responses

Text Search (New) returns a[JSON object as a response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText#response-body). In the response:

- The`places`array contains all matching places.
- Each place in the array is represented by a[`Place`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places)object. The`Place`object contains detailed information about a single place.
- The[FieldMask](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#fieldmask)passed in the request specifies the list of fields returned in the`Place`object.
- The list of places returned is not guaranteed to be consistent for identical requests.

The complete JSON object is in the form:  

```text
{
  "places": [
    {
      object (Place)
    }
  ]
}
```
| **Note:**Text Search (New) returns a maximum of 60 results across all pages, although this limit is subject to change.

## Required parameters

-

  ### FieldMask

  Specify the list of fields to return in the response by creating a[response field mask](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/choose-fields). Pass the response field mask to the method by using the URL parameter`$fields`or`fields`, or by using the HTTP header`X-Goog-FieldMask`. There is no default list of returned fields in the response. If you omit the field mask, the method returns an error.

  Field masking is a good design practice to ensure that you don't request unnecessary data, which helps to avoid unnecessary processing time and billing charges.

  Specify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example, to retrieve the display name and the address of the place.  

  ```javascript
  X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress
  ```
  | **Note:**Spaces are not allowed anywhere in the field list.

  Use`*`to retrieve all fields.  

  ```javascript
  X-Goog-FieldMask: *
  ```
  | While the wildcard (\*) is fine to use in development, Google discourages the use of the wildcard response field mask in production because of the large amount of data that can be returned.
  | Further guidance for using`places.iconMaskBaseUri`and`places.iconBackgroundColor`can be found in[Place Icons](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/icons)section.

  Specify one or more of the following fields:

    ^\*^Text Search and Nearby Search only
-

  ### textQuery

  The text string on which to search. For example, "restaurant", "123 Main Street", or "Best place to visit in San Francisco". The API returns candidate matches based on this string and orders the results based on their perceived relevance.

  Text Search (New) is**not**intended for ambiguous queries, including the following:

  |                                                 Query type                                                 |                             Example                              |
  |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Too many concepts or constraints, such as the names of multiple places, roads, or cities in a single query | *"Market Street San Francisco San Jose Airport"*                 |
  | Postal address elements not represented on Google Maps                                                     | *"C/O John Smith 123 Main Street"* *"P.O. Box 13 San Francisco"* |
  | Names of businesses, chains, or categories combined with locations where these entities are not available  | *"Tesco near Dallas, Texas"*                                     |
  | Ambiguous queries with multiple interpretations                                                            | *"Charger drop-off"*                                             |
  | Historical names no longer in use                                                                          | *"Middlesex United Kingdom"*                                     |
  | Non-geospatial elements or intent                                                                          | *"How many boats are in Ventura Harbor?"*                        |
  | Unofficial or vanity names                                                                                 | *"The Jenga"* *"The Helter Skelter"*                             |
  | Latitude and longitude coordinates                                                                         | *"37.422131,-122.084801"*                                        |

  | **Note:** For best results when searching on a phone number, include the country code followed by a space, and set the[`regionCode`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#regioncode)parameter to correspond to the country code. Phone number formats vary by country and the API attempts to return a result for these different formats.

## Optional parameters

-

  ### includedType

  Biases the results to places matching the specified type defined by[Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a). Only one type may be specified. For example:
  - `"includedType":"bar"`
  - `"includedType":"pharmacy"`

  | **Note:** The values in[Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-b)are only returned in the response. You cannot use values in[Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-b)as a filter.

  Text Search (New) applies type filtering for certain queries, depending on applicability. For example, type filtering may not be applied to queries for specific addresses ("123 Main Street"), but type filtering is almost always applied to categorical queries ("stores nearby" or "shopping malls").

  To apply type filtering to all queries, set[`strictTypeFiltering`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#stricttypefiltering)to`true`.
  | This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
-

  ### includePureServiceAreaBusinesses

  If set to`true`, the response includes businesses that visit or deliver to customers directly, but don't have a physical business location. If set to`false`, the API returns only businesses with a physical business location.
-

  ### languageCode

  The language in which to return results.
  - See the[list of supported languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.
  - If`languageCode`is not supplied, the API defaults to`en`. If you specify an invalid language code, the API returns an`INVALID_ARGUMENT`error.
  - The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.
  - If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.
  - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.
-

  ### locationBias

  Specifies an area to search. This location serves as a bias which means results around the specified location can be returned, including results outside the specified area.

  You can specify`locationRestriction`or`locationBias`, but not both. Think of`locationRestriction`as specifying the region which the results must be within, and`locationBias`as specifying the region that the results will likely be inside or near but can be outside of the area.
  | **Note:** If you omit both`locationBias`and`locationRestriction`, then the API uses IP biasing by default. With IP biasing, the API uses the device's IP address to bias the results.
  | **Note:** The`locationBias`parameter can be overridden if the`textQuery`contains an explicit location such as`Market in Barcelona`. In this case,`locationBias`is ignored.

  Specify the region as a**rectangular Viewport** or as a**circle**.
  - A circle is defined by center point and radius in meters. The radius must be between 0.0 and 50000.0, inclusive. The default radius is 0.0. For example:

    ```javascript
    "locationBias": {
      "circle": {
        "center": {
          "latitude": 37.7937,
          "longitude": -122.3965
        },
        "radius": 500.0
      }
    }
    ```
  - A rectangle is a latitude-longitude viewport, represented as two diagonally opposite low and high points. The low point marks the southwest corner of the rectangle, and the high point represents the northeast corner of the rectangle.

    A viewport is considered a closed region, meaning it includes its boundary. The latitude bounds must range between -90 to 90 degrees inclusive, and the longitude bounds must range between -180 to 180 degrees inclusive:
    - If`low`=`high`, the viewport consists of that single point.
    - If`low.longitude`\>`high.longitude`, the longitude range is inverted (the viewport crosses the 180 degree longitude line).
    - If`low.longitude`= -180 degrees and`high.longitude`= 180 degrees, the viewport includes all longitudes.
    - If`low.longitude`= 180 degrees and`high.longitude`= -180 degrees, the longitude range is empty.
    - If`low.latitude`\>`high.latitude`, the latitude range is empty.

    Both low and high must be populated, and the represented box cannot be empty. An empty viewport results in an error.

    For example, this viewport fully encloses New York City:  

    ```javascript
    "locationBias": {
      "rectangle": {
        "low": {
          "latitude": 40.477398,
          "longitude": -74.259087
        },
        "high": {
          "latitude": 40.91618,
          "longitude": -73.70018
        }
      }
    }
    ```
-

  ### locationRestriction

  Specifies an area to search for**categorical queries only**, which can return multiple places (for example, "Restaurants in New York" or "Shopping malls"). Results outside the specified area are not returned.

  Specify the region as a**rectangular Viewport** . For an example of defining the Viewport, see the description of[`locationBias`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#location-bias).

  You can specify`locationRestriction`or`locationBias`, but not both. Think of`locationRestriction`as specifying the region which the results must be within, and`locationBias`as specifying the region that the results will likely be inside or near but can be outside of the area.
  | **Note:** If you omit both`locationBias`and`locationRestriction`, then the API uses IP biasing by default. With IP biasing, the API uses the IP address of the device to bias the results.
-

  ### maxResultCount (deprecated)

  | **Deprecated:** This field is deprecated in favor of[`pageSize`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#pagesize). If both`maxResultCount`and`pageSize`are specified,`pageSize`will be used and`maxResultCount`will be ignored.

  Specifies the number of results (between 1 and 20) to display per page. For example, setting a`maxResultCount`value of 5 will return up to 5 results on the first page. If there are more results that can be returned from the query, the response includes a`nextPageToken`that you can pass into a subsequent request to access the next page.
  | **Note:** If`maxResultCount`is 0 or unspecified, the API will return 20 results per page by default. If`maxResultCount`is greater than 20, the API will return no more than 20 results per page.
-

  ### evOptions

  Specifies parameters for identifying available electric vehicle (EV) charging connectors and charging rates.
  -

    #### connectorTypes

    Filters by the type of EV charging connector available at a place. A place that does not support any of the connector types will be filtered out. Supported EV charging connector types include combined (AC and DC) chargers, Tesla chargers, GB/T-compliant chargers (for EV fast charging in China), and wall outlet chargers. For more information, see the[reference documentation.](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText#evoptions)
    - To filter results for a[specific supported connector](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places#evconnectortype), set`connectorTypes`to that value. For example, to find J1772 type 1 connectors, set`connectorTypes`to`EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_J1772`.
    - To filter results for**unsupported** connectors, set`connectorTypes`to`EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_OTHER`.
    - To filter results for any connector type that is a wall outlet, set`connectorTypes`to`EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED_WALL_OUTLET`.
    - To filter results for any connector type, either set`connectorTypes`to`EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED`or don't set a value for`connectorTypes`.
  -

    #### minimumChargingRateKw

    Filters places by minimum EV charging rate in kilowatts (kW). Any places with charging a rate less than the minimum charging rate are filtered out. For example, to find EV chargers with charging rates that are at least 10 kW, you can set this parameter to "10."
-

  ### minRating

  Restricts results to only those whose average user rating is greater than or equal to this limit. Values must be between 0.0 and 5.0 (inclusive) in increments of 0.5. For example: 0, 0.5, 1.0, ... , 5.0 inclusive. Values are rounded up to the nearest 0.5. For example, a value of 0.6 eliminates all results with a rating less than 1.0.
  | This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
-

  ### openNow

  If`true`, return only those places that are open for business at the time the query is sent. If`false`, return all businesses regardless of open status. Places that don't specify opening hours in the Google Places database are returned if you set this parameter to`false`.
  | This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
-

  ### pageSize

  Specifies the number of results (between 1 and 20) to display per page. For example, setting a`pageSize`value of 5 will return up to 5 results on the first page. If there are more results that can be returned from the query, the response includes a`nextPageToken`that you can pass into a subsequent request to access the next page.
  | **Note:** If`pageSize`is 0 or unspecified, the API will return 20 results per page by default. If`pageSize`is greater than 20, the API will return no more than 20 results per page.
-

  ### pageToken

  Specifies the`nextPageToken`from the response body of the previous page.
-

  ### priceLevels

  Restrict the search to places that are marked at certain price levels. The default is to select all price levels.

  Price levels can be expected for places of the following types:
  - [Food and Drink](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#food-and-drink)
  - [Services](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#services)
  - [Shopping](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#shopping)

  Places of non-supported types won't be included in the response if`priceLevels`is specified.

  Specify an array of one or more of values defined by[`PriceLevel`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places#pricelevel).

  For example:  

  ```javascript
  "priceLevels":["PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE", "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE"]
  ```
  | **Note:** `PRICE_LEVEL_FREE`is not allowed in a request. It is only used to populate the response.
  | This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
-

  ### rankPreference

  Specifies how the results are ranked in the response based on the type of query:
  - For a categorical query such as "Restaurants in New York City",`RELEVANCE`(rank results by search relevance) is the default. You can set`rankPreference`to`RELEVANCE`or`DISTANCE`(rank results by distance).
  - For a non-categorical query such as "Mountain View, CA", we recommend that you leave`rankPreference`unset.

  | This parameter does not apply to hotel queries or geopolitical queries (for example, queries related to administrative areas, localities, postal codes, school districts, or countries).
-

  ### regionCode

  The region code used to format the response, specified as a[two-character CLDR code](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html)value. This parameter can also have a bias effect on the search results. There is no default value.

  If the country name of the`formattedAddress`field in the response matches the`regionCode`, the country code is omitted from`formattedAddress`. This parameter has no effect on`adrFormatAddress`, which always includes the country name when available, or on`shortFormattedAddress`, which never includes it.

  Most CLDR codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"). The parameter can affect results based on applicable law.
-

  ### strictTypeFiltering

  Used with the`includedType`parameter. When set to`true`, only places that match the specified types specified by`includedType`are returned. When false, the default, the response can contain places that don't match the specified types.

## Text Search (New) examples

### Find a place by query string

The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia":  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

Note that the`X-Goog-FieldMask`header specifies that the[response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText#response-body)contains the following data fields:`places.displayName,places.formattedAddress`. The response is then in the form:  

```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "formattedAddress": "367 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    {
      "formattedAddress": "175 First Ave, Five Dock NSW 2046, Australia",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Veggo Sizzle - Vegan & Vegetarian Restaurant, Five Dock, Sydney",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    {
      "formattedAddress": "29 King St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Peace Harmony",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Add more data types to the field mask to return additional information. For example, add`places.types,places.websiteUri`to include the restaurant type and Web address in the[response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText#response-body):  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia"

```

### Filter places by price level

Use the`priceLevel`option to filter the results to restaurants defined as inexpensive or moderately expensive:  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "Spicy Vegetarian Food in Sydney, Australia",
  "priceLevels":["PRICE_LEVEL_INEXPENSIVE", "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE"]
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress,places.priceLevel' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

This example also uses the`X-Goog-FieldMask`header to add the`places.priceLevel`data field to the[response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchText#response-body)so it is in the form:  

```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "formattedAddress": "367 Pitt St, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia",
      "priceLevel": "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    {
      "formattedAddress": "115 King St, Newtown NSW 2042, Australia",
      "priceLevel": "PRICE_LEVEL_MODERATE",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Green Mushroom",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Add additional options to refine your search, such as`includedType`,`minRating`,`rankPreference`,`openNow`, and other parameters described in[Optional parameters](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/text-search#optional-parameters).
| **Note:**These refinement parameters only apply to queries such as "Restaurants in New York City" where the parameters help to reduce the number of search results based on the specified option. Applying these parameters to other type of queries---for example, to geographical queries such as "Mountain View, CA" or "New York City"---can actually result in filtering out meaningful results or reducing the number of meaningful results.

### Restrict search to a specified area

Use`locationRestriction`or`locationBias`, but not both, to restrict a search to an area. Think of`locationRestriction`as specifying the region which the results must be within, and`locationBias`as specifying the region that the results must be near but can be outside of the area.
| **Note:** When using`locationRestriction`, you can only specify the region as a**rectangular Viewport** . When using`locationBias`, you can specify the region as a**rectangular Viewport** or as a**circle**.

#### Restrict area using locationRestriction

Use the`locationRestriction`parameter to restrict query results to a specified region. In your request body, specify the`low`and`high`latitude and longitude values that define the region boundary.

The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for "vegetarian food" in New York City. This request only returns the first 10 results for places that are open.  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "vegetarian food",
  "pageSize" : "10",
  "locationRestriction": {
    "rectangle": {
      "low": {
        "latitude": 40.477398,
        "longitude": -74.259087
      },
      "high": {
        "latitude": 40.91618,
        "longitude": -73.70018
      }
    }
  }
}' \

  -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
  -H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id,places.formattedAddress' \
  'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

#### Bias to an area using locationBias

The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for "vegetarian food" biased to a location within 500 meters of a point in downtown San Francisco. This request only returns the first 10 results for places that are open.  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "vegetarian food",
  "openNow": true,
  "pageSize": 10,
  "locationBias": {
    "circle": {
      "center": {"latitude": 37.7937, "longitude": -122.3965},
      "radius": 500.0
    }
  },
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

### Search for EV chargers with a minimum charging rate

Use`minimumChargingRateKw`and`connectorTypes`to search for places with available chargers that are compatible with your EV.

The following example shows a request for Tesla and J1772 type 1 EV charging connectors with a minimum charging rate of 10 kW in Mountain View, CA. Only four results are returned.  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
    "textQuery": "EV Charging Station Mountain View",
    "pageSize": 4,
    "evOptions": {
      "minimumChargingRateKw": 10,
      "connectorTypes": ["EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_J1772","EV_CONNECTOR_TYPE_TESLA"]
    }
  }' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.evChargeOptions" \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

The request returns the following response:  

```json

### Search for service area businesses

Use the`includePureServiceAreaBusinesses`parameter to search for businesses without a physical service address (for example, a mobile cleaning service or a food truck).

The following example shows a request for plumbers in San Francisco:  

```
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery" : "plumber San Francisco",
  "includePureServiceAreaBusinesses": true
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H 'X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress' \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```

In the response, businesses without a physical service address don't include the`formattedAddress`field:  

```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "formattedAddress": "3450 Sacramento St #204, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Advanced Plumbing & Drain",
        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    {
      "formattedAddress": "1455 Bancroft Ave, San Francisco, CA 94124, USA",
      "displayName": {

        "languageCode": "en"
      }
    },
    {
      "formattedAddress": "78 Dorman Ave, San Francisco, CA 94124, USA",
      "displayName": {
        "text": "Cabrillo Plumbing, Heating & Air",

      }
    },
    /.../
    {

      }
    },
    /.../
  ]
}
```

### Specify a number of results to return per page

Use the`pageSize`parameter to specify a number of results to return per page. The`nextPageToken`parameter in the response body provides a token that can be used in subsequent calls to access the next page of results.

The following example shows a request for "pizza in New York" limited to 5 results per page:  

```
 curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery": "pizza in New York",
  "pageSize": 5
  }' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id,nextPageToken" \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```  

```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "id": "ChIJifIePKtZwokRVZ-UdRGkZzs"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJPxPd_P1YwokRfzLhSiACEoU"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJrXXKn5NZwokR78g0ipCnY60"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJ6ySICVZYwokR9rIK8HjXhzE"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJ6xvs94VZwokRnT1D2lX2OTw"
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "AeCrKXsZWzNVbPzO-MRWPu52jWO_Xx8aKwOQ69_Je3DxRpfdjClq8Ekwh3UcF2h2Jn75kL6PtWLGV4ecQri-GEUKN_OFpJkdVc-JL4Q"
}
```

To access the next page of results, use`pageToken`to pass in the`nextPageToken`in the request body:  

```
 curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery": "pizza in New York",
  "pageSize": 5,
  "pageToken": "AeCrKXsZWzNVbPzO-MRWPu52jWO_Xx8aKwOQ69_Je3DxRpfdjClq8Ekwh3UcF2h2Jn75kL6PtWLGV4ecQri-GEUKN_OFpJkdVc-JL4Q"
  }' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY' \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.id,nextPageToken" \
'https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText'
```  

```json
{
  "places": [
    {
      "id": "ChIJL-LN1N1ZwokR8K2jACu6Ydw"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJjaD94kFZwokR-20CXqlpy_4"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJ6ffdpJNZwokRmcafdROM5q0"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJ8Q2WSpJZwokRQz-bYYgEskM"
    },
    {
      "id": "ChIJ8164qwFZwokRhplkmhvq1uE"
    }
  ],
  "nextPageToken": "AeCrKXvPd6uUy-oj96W2OaqEe2pUD8QTxOM8-sKfUcFsC9t2Wey5qivrKGoGSxcZnyc7RPmaFfAktslrKbUh31ZDTkL0upRmaxA7c_c"
}
```
| **Note:** All parameters other than`maxResultCount`,`pageSize`, and`pageToken`must be the same as the previous request. Otherwise, the API returns an`INVALID_ARGUMENT`error.

### Get address descriptors

Address descriptors provide relational information about a place's location, including nearby landmarks and containing areas.
| **Note:** Address descriptors are generally available for customers in India and are experimental elsewhere. Places API requests that use only`addressDescriptor`in the field mask will be billed at[SKU: Places API Text Search Pro](https://developers.google.com/maps/billing-and-pricing/sku-details#text-search-pro-sku).

The following example shows a Text Search (New) request for places near a mall in San Jose. In this example, you include`addressDescriptors`in the field mask:  

```curl
curl -X POST -d '{
  "textQuery": "clothes",
  "maxResultCount": 5,
  "locationBias": {
    "circle": {
      "center": {
        "latitude": 37.321328,
        "longitude": -121.946275
      }
    }
  },
  "rankPreference":"RANK_PREFERENCE_UNSPECIFIED"
}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY" \
-H "X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.addressDescriptor" \
https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchText
```

The response includes the place specified in the request, a list of nearby landmarks and their distance from the place, and a list of areas and their containment relationship to the place:  

```json
